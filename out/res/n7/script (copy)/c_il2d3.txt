{textColor 0 2}I'm on the pier, leisurely dangling my fishing line. 
{textColor 0 2}Like the last time, Haruka constantly repeats the cycle of catching a fish, then letting it go. 
{textColor 0 2}She stares at her fishing line with a delighted expression on her face. 
{textColor 0 2}Now that I think about it, Haruka's expression feels like it's become much more happier than it was in the last history. 
{textColor 0 2}(... Why is that?) 
{textColor 0 2}The answer hits me; on the last 2nd, she had a quarrel with Saki at this pier. 
{textColor 0 2}But this time, that never happened... so Haruka might not be depressed as she was last time. 
{textColor 0 2}At any rate, her cheerfulness is helping me relax. 
{textColor 0 2}Ever since last night, my mind's been endlessly running around in circles because of Izumi-san's words about the "remaining mysteries", but thanks to this truly pleasant scene, I've almost forgotten about that.
