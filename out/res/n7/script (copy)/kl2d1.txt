{textColor 0 2}Kurumi is alive――finding that out was the happiest moment of my life. 
{textColor 0 2}I'm so ecstatic that it feels as if every fiber of my being is dancing in joy. 
{textColor 0 2}But...  {textColor 0 2}... At the same time, I can't get rid of this profound feeling of loneliness whirling around in my heart. 
{textColor 0 2}"Nope... never seen him before."  {textColor 0 2}Kurumi's words were incredibly painful... 
{textColor 0 2}(Why did this happen?) 
{textColor 0 2}I don't know the reason.  {textColor 0 2}I don't know the reason, but there's just two things I've confirmed. 
{textColor 0 2}――I time traveled.  {textColor 0 2}On that day... on that rainy morning, I leapt through time, back into the past. 
{textColor 0 2}That's why I'm re-experiencing the morning of the 1st right now. 
{textColor 0 2}And the other thing I've confirmed is...  {textColor 0 2}――This is an infinite loop.  {textColor 0 2}This is definitely not the first time I've time traveled. 
{textColor 0 2}The reason why I can say this is because of that hopeless dream I had on the morning of the last 1st...  {textColor 0 2}That scene was exactly the same scene from "yesterday"... 
{textColor 0 2}If that's the case, then before the last loop, I must have experienced those same six days before. 
{textColor 0 2}And if I take that to its logical conclusion, then they happened again before that, and before that... In other words, I've been living through those six days an infinite number of times. 
{textColor 0 2}And if I think about it conversely, then after this, those same six days will repeat endlessly for all of eternity... 
{textColor 0 2}No...{delay 5}{delay 5}{delay 5} that's wrong...  {textColor 0 2}... There's one very clear difference from the "me" of today and the "me" of the last loop's 1st. 
{textColor 0 2}――My memories.  {textColor 0 2}I clearly remember what happened in those last six days, don't I?! 
{textColor 0 2}In that case, then there's no way I'm gonna let history repeat itself!  {textColor 0 2}That's right! With these hands, I can change history! 
{textColor 0 2}Why did I time travel?  {textColor 0 2}The reason doesn't matter now. 
{textColor 0 2}All that matters is that this is my chance. This is my last chance to cosign that repulsive history into oblivion. 
{textColor 0 2}I don't know if there'll be another 1st or not.  {textColor 0 2}For argument's sake, even if there is, I might not have my memories, just like the last loop. 
{textColor 0 2}That's why this is my last chance... 
{textColor 0 2}――I won't make the same mistake again!  {textColor 0 2}――I will definitely protect Kurumi!  {textColor 0 2}――I won't let Kurumi's smile disappear!

{textColor 0 2}We decide to walk down Moon Beach instead of the paved road. 
{textColor 0 2}As I am the last one to leave the shop, I follow the others from behind. 
{textColor 0 2}At the head are Yuka and Saki, who are talking about stories from their past. 
{textColor 0 2}Okuhiko, true to his skirt-chaser nature, looks at Haruka's face again and again while attempting to strike up a conversation. 
{textColor 0 2}... Suddenly, I stop walking. 
{textColor 0 2}Now that I think about it, it was right about now that I found that "bell" washed up on the beach! 
{textColor 0 2}I threw the bell back into the ocean... and somehow Kurumi picked it up on Princess Beach. 
{textColor 0 2}Why on Princess Beach? ――That's not the current problem! 
{textColor 0 2}The important part is the fact that "in my dream on the morning of the 1st in the last loop, that bell was there." 
{textColor 0 2}And yesterday, it was in Kurumi's palm as well... 
{textColor 0 2}Perhaps if it weren't for that bell, that tragedy might not have occurred. 
{textColor 0 2}No, that's definitely true. 
{textColor 0 2}Of course, it's not like the bell was the direct cause of that incident... 
{textColor 0 2}... But if I could annihilate that bell from this world, then I should be able to sever the infinite loop! 
{textColor 0 2}If that bell is gone, then the chances of the circumstances being the same as that dream will become 0%. 
{textColor 0 2}In other words, it would be absolutely impossible for the same event as that dream to occur! 
{textColor 0 2}Why didn't I realize such an important thing until now? 
{textColor 0 2}Because I've been thinking too much today, my head's been going in circles! 
{textColor 0 2}Well, that doesn't matter. 
{textColor 0 2}――Anyway, I've got to hurry and look for the bell!  {textColor 0 2}... Be that as it may, it still doesn't change the fact that it's been six days. 
{textColor 0 2}I've forgotten exactly where the bell was. 
{textColor 0 2}I decide to check only the wet sand, where the waves are washing up... 
{textColor 0 2}As I begin to look, I totter and meander on the sand as I begin investigating... 
{textColor 0 2}... ... ... 
{textColor 0 2}――It's not here!  {textColor 0 2}Why isn't it here!? 
{textColor 0 2}I retrace my steps one more time, concentrating as hard as I can while looking more carefully at my feet...
