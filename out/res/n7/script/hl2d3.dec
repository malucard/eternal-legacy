{textColor 0 2}One day, Izumi-san's parents went out shopping, taking their one-month old baby with them...

And in the next, she had suddenly vanished.  {textColor 0 2}All that was left was her empty stroller...   {textColor 0 2}In other words, Kurumi had been kidnapped. 
{textColor 0 2}According to the witnesses, the kidnapper's demands were already left behind in the stroller.  {textColor 0 2}A bounty for the criminal was quickly placed as the police tirelessly searched for Kurumi.  {textColor 0 2}The media extensively reported on this, but...

{textColor 0 2}... And then, around one year after Kurumi's disappearance...  {textColor 0 2}... Dr. Morino decided to recreate Kurumi.   {textColor 0 2}"I want to see my child again, no matter what..."   {textColor 0 2}With these sentiments that any parent must have, he thought to use his own technology to achieve them. 
{textColor 0 2}If anyone found out, he'd be severely punished and also booted from the world of genetic engineering.  {textColor 0 2}Despite that, the doctor began work on creating a clone. 
{textColor 0 2}First, Dr. Morino obtained a sample of Kurumi's blood.  {textColor 0 2}It was held in the cold storage of a university hospital, because it had been taken from Kurumi immediately after birth in order to be examined to see whether or not she had any infectious diseases or any abnormalities in her white blood cells and the like.  {textColor 0 2}The nucleus extracted from Kurumi's blood cell was then transplanted into an egg cell that had already had its nucleus extracted, then implanted into the mother's womb.
