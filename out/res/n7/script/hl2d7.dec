{textColor 0 2}Haruka is waving her hand towards outside the window...  {textColor 0 2}It's clear that she's going to miss them... 
{textColor 0 2}But there's no signs that this parting is a sad one. 
{textColor 0 2}Haruka's perfectly clear smile is bathed by the gentle spring sunlight. 
{textColor 0 2}In that expression of hers, something has vividly emerged: it's clearly her heart. 
{textColor 0 2}Right now, Haruka might have finally been awoken from an eternal sleep that lasted one hundred years...

{textColor 0 2}And she is released from the curse of time.  {textColor 0 2}From now on, I won't be able to repeat and do things over. 
{textColor 0 2}... Even so... Even so, Haruka is by my side. 
{textColor 0 2}As long as Haruka has her precious smile, I can keep walking, no matter time may throw at me. 
{textColor 0 2}Because the one who discovered their own existence... {delay 60}wasn't just Haruka...
