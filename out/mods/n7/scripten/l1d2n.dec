{textColor 1 5}【Haruka】 "Will you really teach me?" 
{textColor 0 2}This time, I'm the one to nod. Now that I think about it, up until now, I've never really tried to learn about Haruka. 
{textColor 0 2}If she wants to learn how to fish, then I'll give her all the help she needs. 
{textColor 0 2}I want to get to know her better and start to understand her feelings. 
{textColor 0 2}I want to understand the depths of the emotions of this girl who says she has no "heart".  After that, won't it be all right to ask her about Saki? 
{textColor 0 2}That's what I think.

{textColor 0 2}Haruka slowly nods.  {textColor 0 2}It looks like she wanted to say something. 
{textColor 0 2}Like this, she'll learn more and more. Slowly, but surely, her "heart" will be born. Even Haruka should be able to realize that. 
{textColor 0 2}That's what I think...
