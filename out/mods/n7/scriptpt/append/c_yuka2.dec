@text Just as we promised yesterday, the six of us go to the pool. 
@text Kurumi stays behind this time too, due to her headache. 
@text There isn't even a single cloud visible in the clear blue sky. The gentle spring sunlight bathes us with its warming rays. The air contains a faint scent of seawater. 
@text Everyone spends the time having fun, like last time. 
@text But I... I'm... the only one feeling depressed. 
@text Right now, I'm lying down on a deck chair while idly passing the time. 
@text My mind feels clear and my body's languid... 
@text It's as if I'm in the middle of some kind of dream. 
@text There's a group of kids playing innocently in the water... 
@text It's nothing but a peaceful scene. 
@text 【Yuka】 "Haah..." 
@text ... Even so, a sigh leaks from my mouth. 
@text It feels like a heavy darkness has enveloped my heart. 
@text Could the irritation I felt yesterday still be bugging me...? 
@text Or did I simply not get enough sleep...? 
@text ... 
@text Or could it be both...? 
@text Well, either way, it doesn't change the fact that I'm feeling melancholic. 
@text And so I clap my knees, and stand up. 
@text At times like this, it's time for a change in pace. 
@text For starters... 
@text (Time to get beer♪) 
@text ... I make a bee-line for the beverage stand. 
@text Suddenly, I see someone performing a crawl at the racing section of the pool. 
@text ... It's Makoto. 
@text My gaze shifts from Makoto to his goal. 
@text I impulsively decide to head over there instead of the stand...
