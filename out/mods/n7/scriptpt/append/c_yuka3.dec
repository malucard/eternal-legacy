@text ――I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming of a story that runs by quickly in my long, deep slumber.  If I had to liken this to a color, it would be... purple. The entire world is dyed purple.  In the purple world, a child is crying... 
@text It's a lonely girl, who is either in grade school or about to enter grade school. Could she be a lost child? The girl uneasily looks around her, and scrunches up her face as she bursts into tears again.  Besides the girl is a boy. He seems to be the same age as the girl. 
@text The boy speaks.  "You don't recognize this area...?"  The girl nods, still crying. 
@text "Then go ask a policeman. He'll definitely show you the way home."  "*Hic, hic*..." 
@text "By the way, what's your name? You haven't told me yet."  "Uwaah, uwaah!"   "I can't understand you if all you do is cry..."  "Waah! Waah!" 
@text "*Hic*... I wanna go home..."  "I know...!"  The boy searches through his pocket. Before long, he takes something small out.  "I'll give this to you, so don't cry anymore..."  He takes the girl's hand... ... And places a small object in her palm. 
@text It's... a small key chain.  "Well?♪"  The boy smiles at the girl. 
@text The girl looks back and forth between the key chain in her palm and the boy's face. After a little while, the girl stops crying, and smiles. 
@text "Thank you..."  "Yeah. So, what's you name?"  The girl wipes the tears off her face, and with an awkward voice, she states her name.  "My{delay 30}  name is{delay 10}  ..."
